## Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 

Example 1:

- Input: nums = [7, 0, 0, 1, 7, 7, 2, 7, 7]
- Output: 7

Explanation: 
- The number 7 appears 5 times in the 9 sized array
  
Example 2:

- Input: nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]
- Output: 1

Explanation: 
- The number 1 appears 4 times in the 6 sized array
 

Constraints:

- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 5 * 104
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
